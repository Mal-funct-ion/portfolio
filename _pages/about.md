My name is Hugo Agatep and I am a graduate from Lawrence University with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Geoscience. I was born and raised in the Philippines up until I moved to the US to complete high school and pursue my Bachelor's Degree. As an aspiring game developer, I love games and programming. From JRPGs to RTS to Action-Adventure, I've played a wide variety of games and have experience with a wide variety of gameplay styles and systems. I've also had experience with coding since 2016 and have learned how to use a few programming languages including Python, C++ and Java. 
  
This small website serves as my portfolio for the different games and programs I've had a hand in, whether they be for school work or a personal project, including future projects I make. This page will be where you can check out my current working project. To learn more about what courses I've taken, check out this [page][courses].
