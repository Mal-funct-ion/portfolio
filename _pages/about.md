My name is Hugo Agatep and I am current Junior at Lawrence University majoring in Computer Science and Geoscience. I was born and raised in the Philippines up until I moved
to the US to complete high school and pursue my Bachelor's Degree. As an aspiring game developer, I love games and programming. From JRPGs to RTS to Action-Adventure, I've played a wide variety of games and have experience with a wide variety of gameplay styles and systems. I've also had experience with coding since 2016 and have learned how to use a few programming languages including Python, C++ and Java. 
  
This small website serves as my portfolio for the different games and programs I've had a hand in, whether they be for school work or a personal project, including future projects I make. This page will be where you can check out my current working project. To learn more about what courses I've taken, check out this [page][courses]. 

**Current Project:** Right now, I am currently working on my Senior Capstone, a combination project for my Geoscience and Computer Science majors. It is a Geoscience themed video game where players will attempt to survive in one of three different geologic time eras. The development aspect of the game will focus primarily on Object Oriented Programming and State Machines
